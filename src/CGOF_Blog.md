Started by researching Conway's Game of Life and seeing what it was about, I knew nothing before starting this. 
These are the rules I got from my first research. Cells are alive of dead, if you are alive you need at least two neighboring cells to also be alive to keep living, if you have three you're still alive if you have more neighbors though you die. You can also be born/reborn if as a dead cell, you have at least three alive neighbors.

Alive vs Dead
Alone = Dead
1 Neighbor = Dead
2 Neighbors = Alive
3 Neighbors = Alive or if already Dead then switched to Alive
4+ Neighbors = Dead

This is really getting me excited actually. solving these problems that I have to start working on this project, what language do I use? Can I use both? Where do I start?

What do I need to do?
- Display a grid

to do that I need to
pick a language to display everything
    - Javascript

So javascript for the front-end at the very least
What does the front-end need?
    - A grid (25x25 to start) (I'm thinking 100 x 100 for the future)
    - Display the rules
    - Start / Stop / Clear
